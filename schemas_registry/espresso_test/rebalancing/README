This directory contains hard-coded partition moves for testing 5.3.x milestones.

The files are named with the following naming convention:
	<DBName>_<ReplicationFactor>_<PartitionNo>.json
	Where:
		DBName: Name of the espresso database
		RelicationFactor: Number of replicas that this database has (1 = Master Only, 2 = 1 Master + 1 Slave)
		PartitionNo: Partition Number that is moved. If the replication factor is 1, partition is moved from one storage node to other. If the replication factor is 2, the master and slave storage nodes for the partition are swapped.
	Exammple:
		EspressoDB8_2_0.json: Swaps master and slave nodes for partition 0 of EspressoDB8
		EspressoDB8_1_0.json: Moves master partition 0 of EspressoDB8 from one storage node to other
