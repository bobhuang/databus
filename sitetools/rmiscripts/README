RMI servers scripts: 

RMI server directory layout:

$RMI_HOME/
         /bin/rmifuncs
             /rmiregistrystart
             /rmiregistrystop
             /rmistart
             /rmistatus
             /rmistop
         /codebase/
                  /<servername>
                              /serverAstubs.jar

         /conf/rmi_conf.sh

         /lib/
             /supporting.jar

         /logs/
              /<servername>.log
              /<servername>.pid

         /servers/
                 /<servername>/
                         /conf/
                              /server_conf.sh
                         /lib/
                              /serverAmain.jar
                              /supporting.jar 


Configuration is done via two files that are 'source'd by the rmiscripts.
Should not contain logic, simply name/value pairs in sh assignment syntax.

$RMI_HOME/conf/rmi_conf.sh 
$RMI_HOME/servers/<servername>/conf/server_conf.sh:  

See comments in these files for what needs to be configured.

Each server is has two deployment directories;
  
  $RMI_HOME/codebase/<servername>
    put any class files or jar files that are to be available to clients
    
  $RMI_HOME/servers/<servername>
    configuration file for this server and library jars.
